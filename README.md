<br>The focus of this project is creating a visualization dashboard website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4 based on a past assignment. <br>
For this, we are using “WeatherPy” from “Unit-06-Python-API-challenge”. WeatherPy is a project that evaluates the relationship between longitude and weather factors such as max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. <br>

### Website Structure <br>
For the website, we create individual pages for the analysis of each weather factor, as well as a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them. We'll also have a landing page, where visitors first access the webpage. This page has an explanation of the project, as well as links to other pages. <br>

### Responsive Web Design<br>
One of the requirements of the assignment is that the pages are Responsive pages.  Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones). <br>

We achieve this using bootstrap4 grid (column) system. The pictures below show one of the pages in various sizes.<br>

<br>### Navigation <br>
In this dashboard, we also add means by which visitors can navigate between them. <br>
- Text Links<br>

- Image Links (with hoover)<br>

- Menu Bar<br>

- Navigation Bar (NavBar)<br>
  The navigation bar contains a dropdown menu, and turns to a collapsing button on small screens. <br>

  The navigation bar also provides a link to my personal page.  <br>
